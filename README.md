## Background Information
The Alteryx competition held at their prestigious headquarters in Irvine, CA was a momentous occasion. In collaboration with esteemed Alteryx professionals, participants were given an exclusive glimpse into the inner workings of the Alteryx software, gaining insight into how this innovative tool can be harnessed to streamline data analysis and solve complex organizational problems with ease. The event provided an exceptional opportunity for talented students from various universities, including Cal Poly Pomona, Cal State Fullerton, and Cal State Long Beach, to demonstrate their analytical prowess and presentation skills in a competitive setting, honing their abilities and preparing them for future success in the industry. The event was a resounding success and a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and excellence.
  

## Project Objective
The aim of this project was to conduct thorough Exploratory Data Analysis on fuel economy data obtained from the US Department of Energy. In collaboration with Alteryx's esteemed panel of judges, each team was tasked with crafting a unique proposal based on their findings.

My team focused on highlighting the distinct characteristics of individual vehicles as compared to their competitors, with an emphasis on the environmental impact of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Additionally, we delved into the cost-effectiveness of owning each vehicle, providing valuable information to consumers looking to make informed purchasing decisions. 

## Data & Preparation
The provided from the US Department of Energy was a large dataset encompassing over 80 features and 46,000 rows.
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset to optimize the dataset for analyze on Tableau Desktop
- Employed a range of powerful functions including VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH MATCH, and other aggregate functions to extract valuable insights from the dataset
- Created a pivot table to provide a quick overview of the data, allowing us to identify key trends, patterns, and outliers more efficiently

# Summary of Findings
- There was a strong correltation with cars of the higher percetile of purchasing price having the worst impact on the Environment in respect to Co2 Emssions and Fuel Consumption
- The top prospects were high-end luxury brands such as Bently and Rolls Royce
- The lowest impact of barrels consumed would be brands such Honda and Toyota, both also receiving the avg lowest fuel consumption for gasoline vehicles
- On Average, there has been an overtrend of an increase of total MPG, which is a successful sign of environmental efficiency across the majority of car manufacturers
- EV and Hybrids being the obvious choices in terms of evironmental impacts, but the trade-off of conveinence was not discussed and can be further looked into

## Suggestions 
Based off of our findings our team suggested to look for more affordable car brands manufactured from Toyota or Honda since they both have lower price point (less of risk of inveestent) and they also have the lowest fuel consumption compare to the market. 
If you are investing into elecrtical engines/motors we would reccomoend investing into Hybrids
