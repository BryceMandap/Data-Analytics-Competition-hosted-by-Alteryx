## Project Objective
The aim of this project was to conduct thorough Exploratory Data Analysis on fuel economy data obtained from the US Department of Energy. In collaboration with Alteryx's esteemed panel of judges, each team was tasked with crafting a unique proposal based on their findings.

My team focused on highlighting the distinct characteristics of individual vehicles as compared to their competitors, with an emphasis on the environmental impact of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Additionally, we delved into the cost-effectiveness of owning each vehicle, providing valuable information to consumers looking to make informed purchasing decisions. 

## Data & Preparation
The provided from the US Department of Energy was a large dataset encompassing over 80 features and 46,000 rows.
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset to optimize the dataset for analyze on Tableau Desktop
- Employed a range of powerful functions including VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH MATCH, and other aggregate functions to extract valuable insights from the dataset
- Created a pivot table to provide a quick overview of the data, allowing us to identify key trends, patterns, and outliers more efficiently
